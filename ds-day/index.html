				<dfn>DS Day</dfn> is a day when people play with their old
				DS/GameBoy-family systems. It's a time to have fun, relive
				positive memories, and experience the hyper-specific joys of
				these old handhelds.
			</p>
			<p>
				When is it? Well, there isn't necessarily any <em>one</em>
				DS Day. You can see if there's one you can join in on or arrange
				your own! You have to get some people to commit to it, though.
				Personally, I might announce it to a local but sizeable
				community where a lot of people are likely to own one of these
				systems, like a school or city.
			</p>
			<p>
				The exact parameters may vary—location, timing, allowed
				devices… but the core idea is to have fun with old handheld
				gaming systems in the modern day.
			</p>
			<p><strong>
				This site provides resources to help you arrange and/or have as much fun as possible on DS Day!
